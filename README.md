<h1>Vulnerability Managment using Nessus</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of the vulnerability scanner Nessus.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure(Virtual Machines)
- Remote Dektop
- Nessus Vulnerability Scanner

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)


<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

First, create two VMs that are both running Windows 10. Connect to both of them using RDP. We're going to want to ensure connectivity between VM1 and VM2. Find the IPv4 address of VM2 by typing "ipconfig" from the command prompt and then on VM1, try to ping the VM using the VM's IP address. The request will time out so we'll need to change VM2's firewall settings.

<br />

In VM2, type in wf.msc in the search and then click "Windows Defender Firewall Properties". From there, for the Domain, Private, and Public profiles, turn off the firewalls. From VM1 attempt to ping VM2 again, this time it should not time out which means the VMs are connected on the same network.

<br />

Great! Next we're going to download and install Nessus onto VM1 using this link: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials . We'll have to create a username and password to continue the installation. This will take a while.

Once its finished, let's create a new scan. For the name of the scan, you can make it whatever you want. The name I chose will be "Windows 10 Single Host". For the target, type the IP address of VM2. Hit save then run the scan. Wait for the scan to finish. Once finished, we can see the results of the scan. As we can see, not many high or critical vulnerabilities have been detected. This is because we performed a non-credentialed scan. Also, feel free to look around the scan and click on vulnerabilities as this will show you more information on each vulnerability.

Now weâ€™re going to perform a credentialed scan. First, we have to configure VM2 for credentialed scans. Go to "Services" in VM2 and enable "Remote Registry". Next, go to "Advanced Sharing settings" and make sure "file and printer sharing" is turned on. After that, go to "User Account Control Settings" and set it to "Never notify". Then go to Registry Editor and navigate as shown in the 4th slide below and create a new DWORD named "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" and set its value to 1. Restart VM2. Now we can perform a credential scan.

<br />

Go back to Nessus and add the credentials to the scan. The username and password are the ones you created VM2. Then hit save.
